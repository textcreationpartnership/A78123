            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

That of the Danes, two Dukes, ſeven Earles, three Marqueſſes, and fifteene or ſixteen Lords. Theſe are great numbers, and it is to be feared, will do more hurt to our already too poor Country, then they can do good. And yet we muſt have very many more, as well of the barbarous Iriſh, as of the beggarly Scot, and the both proud and fooliſh French.</p>
            <p>We heare certainly, the peace is concluded on in France: and by an expreſſe from P. <hi>Rupert,</hi> the Prince of Wales is aſſured of a ſtrong Hold in Ireland; for the two Princes <hi>Rupert</hi> and <hi>Maurice,</hi> are at Sea with ſeventy two Ships, and Frigots, and their Randezvouz the twelfth of March, are to be within nine Leagues of Dublin, at the Caſtle of Burkley.</p>

            <p>THe Princes departure hence, is all the ſpeech now at the Court, and it's confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reported (which I think is true) that be will be ſuddenly either in Ireland or Scotland, where there are eight thouſand Danes landed, which is confirmed by an expreſſe from Generall Rivin, to the Prince, who was ſent as an Embaſſadour from him thither, and he not only aſsures him of their arrivall, but alſo of the aſſiſtance of a very conſiderable party of Swedes, which were to be disbanded, on the concluſion of the late peace with the Emperour of Germany: but God a vert the danger, that our poore Kingdome is threatned withall.</p>
            <p>Laſt night, I was with one of the Kings owne Servants, who told mee certainely, that the Lord of Newcaſtle, and the Biſhop of Derrie, lately made one of the Kings Privy Counſellours, are employed to Bruxels, to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negotiate for a marriage betweene the King, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:164978:4"/>the Duke of Lorraines onely daughter, who cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely offers two hundred thouſand pounds in ready money, and to furniſh the King with five thouſand Foot, and two thouſand horſe, which he undertakes likewiſe, to pay for ſixe months, if the marriage go on; which he may perform with more eaſineſſe, if the peace between the King of France, and the Arch Duke Leopall take effect; if the peace go not on, there will bee foule doings in Artways, the Arch-Duke being reſolved with fire and ſword to enter the country, and deſtroy all as he goes,</p>
            <p>There is newes here confidently reported a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Kings party, which I hope will not prove true, it is concerning the ſtraight ſiege laid to Dublin, by the Lord of Ormond, and his great Army, I believe you have the Articles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon between him, and the Iriſh, or elſe I ſhould have ſent them to you by this poſt, there is great expectations from Ireland, and a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſtorme threatens to fall on England.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>I</hi> hope now <hi>I</hi> have ſatisfied you in all that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:164978:5"/>you deſire, for you deſired nothing but newes, and you have the truth as near as can be.</p>
            <p>My own going over will be very ſudden, and I hepe to find you at more quietneſse then reports make you to be, which are the hearty prayers of your aſsured friend, and ſervant.</p>
